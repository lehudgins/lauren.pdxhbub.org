I originally wrote this guide to self marketing for the authors published by <a href="http://ooligan.pdx.edu/" target="_blank"> Ooligan Press</a>, but it should be useful any writers looking for help promoting their upcoming book.

### Website

Without a website, you have no way to greet curious internet wanderers. Perhaps they heard an interview with you and want to know more. Unless you have a personal internet presence, your audience will have no way to look you up. They&rsquo;ll have to rely on what others have said about you. Your website should display what titles you have written, an &ldquo;About Me&rdquo; section for biographical information, and ordering information for your books. <a href="http://bookmarketingmaven.typepad.com/book_marketing_maven/2011/10/whats-the-most-important-thing-on-an-author-website.html" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a href="http://janefriedman.com/2012/02/27/effective-author-website/" target="_blank">here</a> is some advice on the content of a useful author&rsquo;s website.

Unless you have the budget to hire a fancy web designer, keep your website simple and easily navigable. You&rsquo;ll have to set up your domain name and hosting. It&rsquo;s acceptable to simply have a blog as a website.

### Blogging

[![Student intstructing](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/instruction-300x200.jpg)](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/instruction.jpg)

Like your website (or as your website), your blog should be neat and tasteful. It&rsquo;s nice to have a professional designer, but if you can&rsquo;t afford it, many blogging platforms, such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/ "wordpress"), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/ "Tumblr"), or [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/ "Blogger") have straightforward templates. For guidance on the content of an effective and provocative blog post, try this [article](http://goinswriter.com/great-blog-post/ "Article"). Blogging is a great search engine optimization (SEO) tool, meaning that it will improve your website&rsquo;s ranking on Google, or whatever search engine potential readers are using. Also, consider offering to do a guest post for another person&rsquo;s blog. This not only does another writer a favor (especially that writer needs to take time off), but it exposes your name and writing to a whole new audience. For this same reason, it&rsquo;s a good idea to comment on other writers&rsquo; blogs. They appreciate your input and their readers get to see that you&rsquo;re out there.

### Social Networking

Yes, you really must. Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, LinkedInâ€”these are some of the major social networking platforms, and therefore the best resources for interacting with fans, other writers, bloggers, print journalists, and booksellers. It&rsquo;s easy to update your friends and followers on your successes all at once. Here are some [helpful tips](http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2011/10/16/7-social-networking-mistakes/ "Social Networking Tips") on social networking and a [guide to Twitter](http://laurenhudgins.com/social-media/an-authors-guide-to-twitter/ "An Author&rsquo;s Guide to Twitter").

### Face-to-face

[![Ooligan Students at the Willamette Writers Conference 2013](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wwc2013-300x189.jpg)](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wwc2013.jpg)Don&rsquo;t forget good old-fashion person-to-person charm. Meet people. Go to writing conferences and book fairs. Set up a booth at local events. Have coffee dates with other writers, people who work at bookstores, enthusiastic fans (they may blog about their day!), or anyone else who might want to promote you or buy your books.

Here are two resources that can help you with self-promotion.
