Consider Twitter a form of &ldquo;microblogging.&rdquo; You have 140 characters to make announcements, express opinions, and promote projects each tweet; so use them wisely. This is a guide to Twitter for beginners. It will help you attract attention, build a solid base of followers, and host electronic conversations.

### What are your Twitter Goals?

[![Nicole at Write to Publish](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Nicole-200x309.jpg)](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Nicole.jpg)At the very least, you need to use Twitter to promote your work. Each time you publish an article or someone writes you a favorable review, you should post that link. Some authors use twitter to share information related to their markets from others. Poetry writers may tweet links to other poets&rsquo; work. Non-fiction writers may tweet up-to-date news about the subject they write on. Fiction writers might post criticism for their genre. This establishes you as an expert or team player in your market.

Twitter is a valuable tool for networking with publishers, journalists, and other professional writers. Find them, follow them, and start conversations with them.

You may want to use twitter to tell your friends and fans about your personal life. Who is the person behind the book? Are you also a chicken farmer? Do you play the accordion? Are you going back to school? But be careful of oversharing. Whatever is on the internet is public and easily spread around. (While it is possible to make a locked and secret account, this isn&rsquo;t very productive promotion or networking.)

### Choosing a Username

The most important thing is to pick a name that is identifiable and searchable. If available, use your first and last name (or your pseudonym). For example, &ldquo;JonathanJones,&rdquo; &ldquo;JonJones,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jon_Jones.&rdquo; This looks professional, makes it clear to whom the account belongs, and is easy to locate on Google or another search engine. If you are setting up an account for a specific project, use the title or name of that project.

### Holding Twitter Conversations

**[![Transmit Culture conversation](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/spencer-300x226.jpg)](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/spencer.jpg)@username**
An **@** in a message links the following word as a twitter username. Usernames are always one word. This will notify a user that you are tweeting to them or about them. It shows up in their list of &ldquo;Interactions.&rdquo;

The following tweets are all different.

-   Hey, dudeman! It&rsquo;s raining. (*useless*)
-   Hey, @dude man! It&rsquo;s raining. (*mentions the user @dude*)
-   Hey, @dudeman! It&rsquo;s raining. (*mentions the user @dudeman*)
-   Hey, @dude_man! It&rsquo;s raining. (*mentions the users @dude_man*)

#### #hashtags

A **#** (hash symbol) creates a link to the following word. If you click on the link, Twitter generates a list of all recent tweets with that hashtag. You can put a hashtag anywhere in a message, but it&rsquo;s customary to add them to the end. Hashtags cannot contain spaces.

-   I hate the #Portland rain. (*Creates search link for Portland.*)
-   I hate the #Portland #rain. (*Creates search links for Portland and rain, separately.*)
-   I hate the Portland rain. #Portlandrain (*Creates search link for Portlandrain.*)

Because hashtags break up the flow of sentences, I recommend always putting them at the end of your tweet. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a choice between an ugly tweet and redundancy. Twitter&rsquo;s search options allow users to search for terms without hashtags, but using relevant hashtags creates that user-friendly instant link. It will make your tweets easier to find.

\#Hashtags and @usernames are not affected by punctuation at the end of the word. You can use as many exclamation points as you want, but I don&rsquo;t recommend it.

(Not used as much in the past year, but still useful information.)

On Friday list influential people on Twitter you follow.You often see something like this:

@abcd @cdef @hijk @lmnop @qrs @tuv @wxyz @123 @456 @789 #FF!!!!!

I find it most useful for readers to see only a few names and an explanation if possible.

Example: For more inspiration, check out @lehudgins (local blogger) and @laura_hudson (Wired editor). #FF

A good policy is to tweet a #FF with two names every Friday. It&rsquo;s a great opportunity to let other users know that you&rsquo;re interested in what they say and quite a nice compliment.

**Retweeting**- repeat what another user has said.

There are two ways to retweet. The *old way* involved the letters &ldquo;RT&rdquo; followed by the name of the person you were retweeting and the message.

Example: RT @lehudgins Wow! The street is filled with marbles! Look out! http://wtfpdx.com/marbles

-   Your name and picture is immediately associated with the information.
-   Allows you to modify the message (MT) and add hashtags.

[![Students in work room](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/work-room2-300x200.jpg)](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/work-room2.jpg)Example: DANGER ALERT! RT @lehudgins Wow! The street is filled with marbles! Look out! http://wtfpdx.com/marbles #caution

-   Difficult to track movement of information

-   It shows up as a &ldquo;mention&rdquo; rather than a retweet

For the *new version* of retweeting, the function is built in. Hover over the message and hit &ldquo;Retweet.&rdquo; (The symbol is a box made of two arrows)

-   Simple! No cutting and pasting. Links are seamless.
-   Easier to track movement of information by viewing &ldquo;Retweets&rdquo;

-   The retweet shows up on the timeline of your followers with the originators name and picture. Your name appears in very tiny, dim font.
-   Exact duplication. Can&rsquo;t modify the message in anyway.

A good policy is to retweet one person per day per feed using the old method. Like #FF, retweeting lets Twitter uses know that we&rsquo;re paying attention and appreciate what they&rsquo;re saying. If you&rsquo;re using Twitter to network, it&rsquo;s great flattery. Vary who you retweet. Share the love and avoid looking like a copybot.

It&rsquo;s polite to credit where you get information. Use &ldquo;via&rdquo; or &ldquo;h/t&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;hat tip to) when you want to share what others have tweeted, but don&rsquo;t want to quote them. This is most often used with sharing links.

Example: Marbles are flooding Portland! http://wtfpdx.com/marbles (via @lehudgins)

**Mentions and Replies**

When someone adds an @ before your screen name in a tweet, it will show up as a mention in your Interactions area. Replies also appear as mentions. To reply to someone&rsquo;s tweet, hover over the message and click on &ldquo;reply.&rdquo; (The symbol looks like a curved arrow pointing left.) It will appear on twitter feeds with their username in the beginning of the tweet.

Example: @lehudgins Thanks for the retweet!

A tweet beginning with a username (such as a reply) will only show up on the twitter feed of you, that person, and anyone who follows both of you. In contrast, mentioning a user in any part of the tweet other than the beginning will appear to anyone who follows you. Replies are not private, while they will not automatically appear in irrelevant feeds, anyone can read replies on your twitter page.

Be sure to monitor your mentions. At the top of your timeline, select the tab labeled &ldquo;Interactions.&rdquo; Most of the time your mentions and replies can be ignored, like &ldquo;Thanks for the RT!&rdquo; Because mentions and replies clutter your twitter feed or page, only respond selectively. If you are trying to build followers, you can be more generous. Replies and mentions build a sense of community and personalization.

Some messages you get will be marketing or promotional attempts (hey @lehudgins Lauren, check out my video of a fat and lazy dog!). These generally won&rsquo;t be interesting and could be spam, but use your discretion based on the source. There&rsquo;s a slim chance it might be something brilliant and useful.

Direct messages (DMs) are private. Only you and the person you are messaging can see them. You can only DM someone who follows you. Direct messages are considered more urgent than replies and mentions. There are few occasions when you would need to begin a conversation using a DM. Like mentions, if you get a DM from someone important in your industry or a question, you should answer. You can and will get spam in a DM. Someone has hacked the account of your contact.

**Links**

Twitter will try to shorten long links to fit within your 140 character limit, but it can still look messy. You may want to shorten it on your own before posting. Here are some websites that will create shorter links for you. Also, try the original source for an article, video, etc. They may have a share with twitter option that will create a shorter, direct link for you.

-   [http://bit.ly/](http://bit.ly/ "Bit.ly")
-   [http://tinyurl.com/](http://tinyurl.com/ "Tiny url")
-   [http://moourl.com/](http://moourl.com/ "Moo URL")

**Shorthand**

Using texting shorthand, such as &ldquo;u&rdquo; for &ldquo;you,&rdquo; or dropping vowels appears unintelligent and is unprofessional. Some more formal shorthand may be acceptable (&ldquo;w/&rdquo; for &ldquo;with&rdquo;, &ldquo;w/o&rdquo; for &ldquo;without&rdquo;, &ldquo;b/c&rdquo; for &ldquo;because&rdquo;). To stay within your 140 character limit, get creative. Is there another way to say what you&rsquo;re trying to say with fewer words? Try using phrases rather than sentences. Drop unnecessary pronouns, lose articles (the/a/an), use &ldquo;&&rdquo; or commas instead of &ldquo;and.&rdquo;

For example:
I heard the dogs are planning to be fat and lazy. -> Heard dogs planning to be fat, lazy.
