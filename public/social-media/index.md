[![Jonathan Stark](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jonathanstark-200x300.jpg)](http://laurenhudgins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/jonathanstark.jpg)What I find so alluring about social media work is the immediate feedback. Using the right tools, I get nearly instantaneous numbers and reactions that tell me that people, perhaps many people, are out there getting the message. It gives me a thrilling dopamine rush.

When social media duties split off from the marketing department, I helped found Ooligan Press’s first social media strategies. I created a [guide to Twitter](http://laurenhudgins.com/social-media/an-authors-guide-to-twitter/ "An Author’s Guide to Twitter") for Ooligan authors new to self-promotion via social networking, which was incorporated into our marketing packet. Posting on Twitter and Facebook became a daily item for Ooligan Press. We set up a regular blog schedule of a rotating list of regular writers. Examples of my blog posts include “[The Partnership Between Ooligan Press and Roosevelt High School](http://ooligan.pdx.edu/the-partnership-between-ooligan-press-and-roosevelt-high-school/ "Ooligan Press and RHS"),” “[A Heartfelt Tale of the Oregon Trail](http://ooligan.pdx.edu/a-heartfelt-tale-of-the-oregon-trail/ "Heart for Any Fate")” (part of our [Backlist to the Future](http://ooligan.pdx.edu/topics/backlist-to-the-future/ "Backlist to the Future") campaign to bring attention to previously published books), and “[We Went to Willamette Writers Conference 2013](http://ooligan.pdx.edu/we-went-to-willamette-writers-conference-2013/ "WW C2013").” [Here](http://ooligan.pdx.edu/author/lauren-hudgins/ "Hudgins blog posts") is a list of most the blog posts I authored.

After two terms working on the press blog, I became the social media manager with responsibility for finding bloggers, scheduling posts, and formatting posts, and gained control of Ooligan Press’s Facebook and Twitter accounts. During the time that I was social media manager (from Winter 2013 until Fall 2013) we gained 192 likes or 31% more likes.

I thought our best strategy was to focus our efforts on Twitter and Facebook, rather than to risk spreading our energy too thinly over many social media platforms. If I were to do it again, I would probably add Tumblr and Instagram into the mix, but only for information about our YA books, since Tumblr and Instagram seem to be preferred social media networks for youth.
