Both as the [social media](http://laurenhudgins.com/social-media/ "Social Media") manager and as a member of work groups, I participated in the marketing of *Close Is Fine*, *Alive at the Center*, *The Ninth Day*, and *The Wax Bullet War*. My marketing efforts for these books included:

-   soliciting blurbs
-   advising authors on [self-marketing](http://laurenhudgins.com/marketing/the-art-of-self-marketing/ "The Art of Self-Marketing")
-   researching media outlets and reviewers
-   contributing to marketing plans and tips sheets
-   generating ideas for and researching collateral
-   posting regular social media updates about events and media recognition
-   writing copy

Below is my proposed copy for the back cover of *The Ninth Day*. While it is not what appears on the book, it did influence the final version.

*Sixteen-year-old Hope Friis lives in Berkeley in radical 1964. The only time she doesn&rsquo;t stutter is when she sings. But after a Halloween accident leaves her face permanently scarred, her family might not allow her to go to a choral competition, and she&rsquo;ll lose her chance to get a scholarship. Her attention-seeking sister, Dagmar, drags her into the fight for free speech on the university campus and she is caught between her loyalty to her sister and the kind, intelligent young activist, Gabriel, and her fear of getting in trouble. Then a mysterious time traveler, Serakh, comes to Hope for help. By means of a mystical shawl given to her by her ailing grandfather, Hope goes back in time to 11th century Paris, tasked with saving the life of an infant. She has nine days to solve a mystery that could save the child and rescue her family&rsquo;s lineage. Can she change the past and secure her future in singing?*

The Ninth Day *is a companion novel to* Blue Thread*, by Ruth Tenzer Feldman, winner of the 2013 Oregon Book Award in Young Adult Literature.*

##### Marketing Plans and Tip Sheets

In the Intro to Book Publishing class we created full marketing plans and tip sheets for theoretical books. For the the mock title *Between Hope and Fear*, I designed the cover and wrote most of the marketing material. The parts that I did not contribute are noted in the pdfs.
